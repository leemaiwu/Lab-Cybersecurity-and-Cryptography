In 2021 Just days after a major Facebook data leak, LinkedIn gets hacked. An archive containing data purportedly scraped from 500 million LinkedIn profiles had been put for sale. There were a total of four leaked files that included information like full names, email addresses, phone numbers, workplace information, and more. The hacker put the information up for sale on a forum asking for a 4 digit minimum in price. LinkedIn has implemented some additional steps to prevent future breaches such as Regular audits, Endpoint protection, and more.
